Programs to explore the project 2025 madness ... 922 pages of heh?

## Setup
1. This is tested using Python 3.12.4, though it should work using other recent python releases. You may need to remove the specific library versions from requirements.txt in the case of some Python versions and let pip sort it out for you. 
2. Create a Python virtual environment. https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#venv-def 
3. Activate that virtual environment: `source /path/to/venv/bin/activate` (You need to do this every time)
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt` (You only need to do this the first time)
5. `python <program name>` (There are several here.)
